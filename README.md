Cocoon Canvas+
=====================

Cocoon Canvas+ are multiplatform Javascript utilities that work in Canvas+. They are included in Canvas+ core, so it is not required to install anything else at the cloud. The required files, if so, will be injected automatically in your project. Only available in [Cocoon.io](http://cocoon.io/) projects.
